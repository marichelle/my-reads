# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement.

## Getting Started

To get started testing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
